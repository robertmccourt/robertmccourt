Hello, my name is Robert McCourt, I am a senior Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of New Mexico. 

My interests include:
- High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Machine Learning & Neural Networks
- Parallelism (OpenMP)
- GPU Programming (CUDA)
- Embedded Systems (Arduino, PCB)
- Learning new languages and libraries. I am currently teaching myself Swift!
- Quantum Computing

A fun fact about me; I disassembled my laptop to see how it worked when I was 13 years old.

I also enjoy many other outdoor activities such as camping, snowboarding, rock climbing, traveling, and in my free time I enjoy playing soccer as well.
