Hello, my name is Robert McCourt. I have completed my undergraduate coursework in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico and am now taking pre-medical prerequisite courses to prepare for medical school. I am passionate about applying computational and analytical skills to advance biomedical research and healthcare.

My interests include:
- High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Machine Learning & Neural Networks
- Parallelism (OpenMP)
- GPU Programming (CUDA)
- Embedded Systems (Arduino, PCB)
- Learning new languages and libraries
- Quantum Computing
- Biomedical Research
- Cellular & Molecular Biology
- General & Organic Chemistry

A fun fact about me; I disassembled my laptop to see how it worked when I was 13 years old.

I also enjoy many other outdoor activities such as camping, snowboarding, rock climbing, traveling, and in my free time I enjoy playing soccer as well.
